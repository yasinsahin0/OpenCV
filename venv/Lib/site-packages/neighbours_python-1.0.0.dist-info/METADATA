# neighbours-python Package

This is a package modified from [NearPy 1.0.0](https://github.com/pixelogik/NearPy/).

I removed normalization for feature vectors to make it find true neighbours when using Euclidian Distance.

I upload it for my own convenience as well as for others who use NearPy in their projects.

The structures and names all remain the same as NearPy. So you can use it exactly the same way as `nearpy` in your python scripts.

For example, you should import this package as:
```python
 import nearpy 
```
